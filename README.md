## About The Project

This is the second project from [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), titled ['Landing Page'](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

My learnings from this project include:
* Recreating a webpage from a provided design with HTML and CSS
* Use of CSS Flexbox for layout and positioning
* Version control using Git and GitHub
